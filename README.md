# Sol-E
A social robot, aimed to promote dialog and interaction with kids by playing a game.
 
The robot shows a picture without any colors, and the child should show the robot a card with the correct color.
 
The pictures include Sun, Flag, Carrot, Leaf, Mouse, Strawberry.
 
If the child chose the correctly colored card, the robot will respond with a smile, will put the color into the picture, and move to the next picture.
If the child chose the wrong color, the robot will show a sad face and ask the child to try again.
After three tries, the robot will put its hands up to show it has given up and move to the next picture. The original picture will reappear later on in the game so that the child will get another chance to choose the right color.
